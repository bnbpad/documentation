# MCP (Model Context Protocol)

## What is MCP?

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is an open protocol that connects AI assistants to external data sources and tools. It standardizes how AI models access real-time information, databases, APIs, and other resources, enabling assistants to retrieve and act on up-to-date data beyond their training. MCP uses a client-server architecture where servers expose resources and tools that clients (AI assistants) can discover and use, making it easier to extend AI capabilities with custom integrations and data sources.
