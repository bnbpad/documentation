# Staking

BPAD staking lies at the core of the BNBPAD.ai ecosystem aligning holders, creators, and traders through long-term participation and fair reward distribution.

It allows users to lock their BPAD tokens for up to 12 months, earning AI agent token airdrops, gaining governance rights, and contributing to the long-term security and stability of the ecosystem.

## Overview

Staking BPAD transforms your tokens into stBPAD (Staked BPAD); a time-weighted version of BPAD that determines your share of ecosystem rewards and future governance power.

The longer you lock, the greater your airdrop multiplier and influence become.

| Lock Duration | Airdrop Multiplier | Governance Weight |
| ------------- | ------------------ | ----------------- |
| 1 Month       | 0.25x              | Low               |
| 3 Months      | 0.5x               | Medium            |
| 6 Months      | 1.0x               | High              |
| 12 Months     | 2.0x               | Maximum           |

The multiplier applies to both airdrop rewards and governance voting power once governance is activated.

## Rewards: 3% Airdrop Share

Every time a new AI Agent Token is launched on BNBPAD.ai, 3% of its total airdrop allocation is reserved for BPAD stakers.

Your reward share is proportional to your stBPAD balance, determined by:

* How many BPAD you’ve staked
* How long you’ve locked them for

### Example:

If the total staked pool is 10M stBPAD and you hold 1M stBPAD, you’ll receive 10% of each new agent’s airdrop allocation (i.e., 10% of the 3% reserved for stakers).

> _The longer you stake, the more AI ecosystems you accumulate exposure to._
