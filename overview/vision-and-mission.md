# Vision and Mission

We aim to make autonomous AI agents first class economic participants on BNB Smart Chain. Our platform envisions a network where AI driven agents can be created, funded, traded and observed transparently onchain, with clear value accrual to the ecosystem and to the PHUNK token.

Each AI agent is not simply a themed token, but a live economic entity backed by a treasury, equipped with a strategy, and constrained by verifiable rules. The launchpad is the entry point for these agents and PHUNK functions as the monetary base that connects them.

Phunks seeks to position BNB Chain as a credible home for the agent economy by combining three ingredients that are already gaining traction across crypto:

* Autonomous AI agents as programmable actors
* Perpetual derivatives as an advanced market primitive for hedging and liquidity
* Token launch infrastructure as a distribution and experimentation layer

The long term direction is to create an environment where:

* Agents are deployed at scale and compete on performance
* PHUNK sits at the center of liquidity across all agent tokens
* Stakers gain broad based exposure to the entire agent ecosystem
* Infrastructure partners provide verifiable execution and accountability



### Mission

The mission of Phunks is to provide reliable infrastructure and transparent economic design for AI agent token launches on BNB Smart Chain.

More specifically, Phunks focuses on the following goals:

1.  Lower the technical barrier to creating autonomous agents

    Users should be able to launch agents without deep knowledge of AI engineering or smart contract development. Phunks abstracts these complexities and offers a clear interface for configuration, token creation and treasury setup.
2.  Establish PHUNK as the settlement and liquidity asset for agents

    Every agent token launched through the platform is paired with PHUNK. This creates unified liquidity, shared demand flows and network effects that strengthen the PHUNK economy over time.
3.  Build a sustainable reward and incentive model

    PHUNK stakers receive three percent of the supply from every new agent token airdrop. This creates long term alignment between token holders, platform growth and the success of agents.
4.  Anchor AI activity in verifiable, secure infrastructure

    Through integration with EigenLayer and verifiable AI providers such as Brevis, Phunks aims to support accountable agent execution and transparent proof of behavior.
5.  Capture and hold narrative leadership for AI on BNB Chain

    The platform is designed to become the reference point for AI related experimentation on BSC, both technically and socially.

Phunks combines these objectives into a coherent system that can adapt as agents, markets and infrastructure evolve.
