# BPAD Tokenomics

BPAD is the core utility and governance token of the BNBPAD.ai ecosystem.

It powers every launch, trade, and staking reward within the AI-driven on-chain economy acting as both the liquidity base and value accrual mechanism of the platform.

## Token Overview

Here we give a brief about some of the key highlights about the BPAD token.

## Token Utility

BPAD drives the economic, liquidity, and incentive layers of BNBPAD.ai. Its utility spans three major functions:

### 1/ Stake to Earn Airdrops

Staking BPAD grants holders access to 3% of every AI agent token launch airdrop.

As new agents are created and distributed through the launchpad, stakers continuously earn portions of these new ecosystems creating passive, compounding exposure to the growing AI economy.

> _The more you stake, the more of the AI ecosystem you own._

### 2/ Native Pairing for All Launches

Every AI agent token launched through BNBPAD.ai is paired with BPAD as its base asset.

This ensures consistent market depth and unified pricing across launches, continuous trading volume for BPAD on both the spot and perp DEX and organic demand growth as more agents enter the ecosystem

> _Every new AI agent increases BPAD’s liquidity footprint._

### 3/ Buyback & Burn Mechanism

A portion of platform revenue generated from launchpad fees, DEX trading fees, and staking is allocated to periodic BPAD buybacks from the open market.

All purchased BPAD is permanently burned, reducing circulating supply and enhancing long-term token value.

> _More activity → more revenue → more BPAD burned._

## Token Distribution

The BPAD supply is designed to ensure fair access, long-term sustainability, and ecosystem growth. With over 65% of the token allocation set for the community and ecosystem growth.
