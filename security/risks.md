# Risks

While Phunks is built on secure, verifiable infrastructure including EigenLayer restaking, Aster DEX integration, and audited smart contracts it still operates at the frontier of AI & DeFi innovation.

With that comes a unique set of risks spanning technical, economic, and behavioral domains.

This document outlines the main categories of risks that participants, creators, and traders should understand before engaging with AI Agentic Tokens or the PHUNK ecosystem.

## 1. AI Execution Risks

These are risks associated with the AI agents themselves.

### 1.1 AI Agent Misbehavior

AI agents are autonomous and make trading or operational decisions based on their inputs, model weights, and market data. There is always a possibility that:

* The AI misinterprets data or market signals
* The underlying model generates poor or irrational outputs
* External conditions cause the model to deviate from its trained intent

Even though EigenLayer AVS validation ensures that actions are authorized and verified, it cannot guarantee profitability or correct market judgment.

> AI agents may act consistently with their logic, yet still incur financial losses.

### 1.2 EOA Compromise (Phase 1)

In early deployments, AI agents use Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) and private keys for on-chain execution. If an EOA key is compromised, leaked, or exploited, an attacker could:

* Drain the agent’s treasury
* Manipulate trading behavior
* Execute unauthorized transactions

This risk is largely prevalent in the phase 1 stage of Phunks, however in phase 2, this risk gets totally mitigated when the EigenLayer infrastructre comes into the picture.

## 2. Smart Contract & Protocol Risks

Risks related to code or smart contracts.

### 2.1 Contract Bugs or Exploits

All smart contracts including those for the launchpad, staking, or trading integrations: carry inherent risks of bugs or vulnerabilities.

A critical bug could result in:

* Loss of funds
* Incorrect reward or airdrop distributions
* Stuck or inaccessible assets

Participants should recognize that no system is fully immune from unknown exploits or logic errors.

### 2.2 Integration Risks

Phunks integrates several third-party systems:

* Aster Perp DEX for trading execution
* EigenLayer for validation and restaking security
* Offchain LLM providers for inference

Any dependency failure, downtime, or upgrade conflict within these systems could affect Phunks’s operations or lead to temporary loss of functionality.

## 3. Economic and Market Risks

Risks associated with trading and general market.

### 3.1 AI Agents Running at a Loss

Each AI agent token has a treasury that trades and compounds autonomously. If its model performs poorly or encounters adverse market conditions:

* The agent’s treasury value may decline
* The token’s market price could fall sharply
* Holders could incur losses from speculation or poor agent performance

While 80% of trading fees are directed back to the treasury, these do not guarantee profitability especially in volatile or illiquid conditions.

### 3.2 Insider or Market Manipulation

Phunks launchpad tokens are open to the public, but like any decentralized market, there is potential for:

* Insider accumulation and pump-and-dump activity before listings
* Front-running or MEV exploits on liquidity pairs
* Coordinated trading manipulation around AI agent launch events

The platform encourages fair launches and community oversight via stPHUNK governance, but participants should remain aware that market behavior cannot be fully controlled.

## Conclusion

Phunks is pioneering a new paradigm of intelligent, verifiable, and self-sustaining AI economies.

While this innovation opens extraordinary opportunities, participants should understand that risk cannot be eliminated only managed.

The protocol’s design integrating EigenLayer restaking, PHUNK-based liquidity, and ve-style staking is built to minimize systemic risks, but users should always:

* Conduct their own research
* Diversify participation
* Engage responsibly with AI-driven financial agents

> _Innovation is powerful - but it demands understanding. Use_ Phunks _with knowledge, not blind trust._
