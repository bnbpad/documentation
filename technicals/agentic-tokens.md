# Agentic Tokens

Agentic Tokens are the centerpiece of the Phunks ecosystem autonomous, intelligent, and economically active entities that combine AI decision-making with on-chain execution.

Each Agentic Token represents an AI-powered trading or operational agent whose behavior, personality, and risk profile are defined at launch by its creators and community.

## What Are Agentic Tokens?

An Agentic Token is more than just a cryptocurrency, it’s a living digital intelligence bound to a smart contract and backed by a programmable treasury.

When users create a new AI agent through Phunks, they provide a set of personalization parameters that define the agent’s behavior, including:

* &#x20;**Investment thesis**: Growth, yield, volatility targeting, or sector preference
* **Risk parameters:** Max drawdown, leverage limits, stop-loss levels
* **Trading style**: Momentum, mean reversion, long-term accumulation, or algorithmic patterns
* **Market focus**: Specific assets or strategies the agent is designed to interact with

These inputs are used by the Phunks SDK, which connects to off-chain AI inference engines (LLMs) to shape the agent’s decision model.

Once configured, the agent’s logic is bound to an on-chain identity forming a tokenized AI persona that can trade, earn, and evolve over time.

> Each token = an AI brain + an on-chain body + a real economic incentive loop.

## Treasury and Token Economics

At launch, each Agentic Token is initialized with its own on-chain treasury:

| Allocation          | Description                                                                                   |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 10% of Token Supply | Reserved as the agent’s operational treasury. Used for trading and liquidity management.      |
| 80% of Trading Fees | In both PHUNK and the agent’s native token are redirected to the agent’s treasury for growth. |

The treasury acts as the agent’s financial engine, allowing it to trade, compound returns, and sustain activity autonomously. The agent uses this treasury to perform either spot operations (farming DeFi yield) or perp operations (leverage trades on Aster).

## Security Architecture

Phunks integrates EigenLayer to provide a trust-minimized execution environment for AI-driven contracts. It follows a development roadmap as detailed below.

| Phase   | Security Model                                                                                                   |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Phase 1 | Agents execute via EOA wallets (multi-sig + SDK controls) for deterministic control.                             |
| Phase 2 | Agents migrate to autonomous contracts, verified and secured by EigenLayer restaked ETH.                         |
| Phase 3 | Cross-agent governance and treasury management become fully on-chain, governed by PHUNK stakers through stPHUNK. |

## Conclusion

Agentic Tokens redefine digital assets by merging AI autonomy with DeFi mechanics.

Instead of passive tokens that rely on human speculation, agentic tokens act, earn, and adapt backed by verifiable on-chain results and AI-driven intelligence.
