# Agent Lifecycle

#### Overview

The lifecycle of an AI agent within Phunks describes how an idea transforms into a live, autonomous trading entity operating entirely onchain. Each phase shapes how the agent’s token, treasury and AI reasoning connect, interact and evolve. By the end of the lifecycle, the agent functions as a self-sustaining participant in the BNB ecosystem, complete with its own balance sheet, strategy and measurable performance.

Phunks follows a clear progression that takes the creator from initial configuration to a fully functioning and upgradeable agent.

### 1. Configuration and Creation

Every agent begins with a creator defining its behavioral blueprint. This includes the agent’s investment thesis, risk profile, trading style and market focus. These parameters form the core identity of the agent and determine how it will interpret market conditions in the future.

Once provided, the configuration is processed by the Phunks SDK and the off-chain AI orchestration layer. The result is a model specific configuration that becomes the agent’s internal logic.

### 2. Token Deployment and Treasury Initialization

After the configuration is established, Phunks deploys the agent onchain. A new token is created with a defined total supply, and ten percent of that supply is allocated to the agent’s treasury. This treasury becomes the financial engine from which all actions are executed.

Metadata linking the token to its AI profile is also registered at this stage, ensuring the agent is recognized across the launchpad ecosystem. From this moment onward, the agent has both an identity and a capital base.

### 3. Liquidity and PHUNK Pairing

To ensure every agent is immediately tradable, Phunks pairs the newly created token with PHUNK as its primary liquidity market. Initial liquidity is seeded using treasury assets and PHUNK liquidity reserves. This pairing places PHUNK at the center of the agent economy and ensures that activity around any single agent contributes to PHUNK volume and depth.

### 4. Activation of AI Logic

With the token live and liquidity established, the agent enters activation. Treasury accounts, trading accounts and strategy constraints are connected to the AI orchestration layer. At this point, the agent is granted visibility into market data, contract state and relevant trading conditions.

The AI engine begins to propose actions, while smart contracts enforce configured constraints. This ensures that the agent cannot act beyond its defined risk boundaries.

***

### 5. Operational Phase

In the operational phase, the agent behaves as an autonomous market participant. It may execute spot strategies, deploy its treasury into yield opportunities or open long and short positions on Aster. The orchestration layer constantly evaluates conditions and generates updated proposals, which are validated and then executed onchain.

Throughout this phase, every action is logged. Treasury balances, open positions and realized performance are visible and auditable. This makes the agent’s activity transparent while allowing creators and observers to monitor progress.

***

### 6. Fee Accrual and Treasury Growth

As the agent operates, it generates trading fees. Phunks routes eighty percent of all fees, whether in PHUNK or the agent’s own token, back into the treasury. This mechanism transforms the treasury into a measurable track record of the agent’s performance.

A successful agent gradually strengthens itself. More fees lead to a larger treasury, which increases the capital available for future trades. Over time, this compounding effect separates effective agents from ineffective ones.

### 7. Governance and Upgrades

In later stages of the Phunks ecosystem, agents may become governed by PHUNK stakers. Once governance is active, stakers can participate in decisions such as adjusting risk parameters, upgrading strategies, altering treasury allocation rules or approving integrations with new markets.

Governance only becomes relevant when the ecosystem is sufficiently mature and when the security model ensures that both agent behavior and staker decisions remain accountable.
